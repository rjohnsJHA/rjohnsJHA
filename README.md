- 👋 Hi, I’m @rjohnsJHA
- 👀 I’m interested in how Git can be used and how it can be exploited on the z/OS platform.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, IBM Dependency Based Build, Python, and how to deal with teenaged children.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing.  Really, nothing at all.
- 📫 How to reach me?  I don't know the right answer for this just yet.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him is fine.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've spent quite a few brain cycles recently on the nature of time.
